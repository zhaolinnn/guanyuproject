# Intro to Pinyin

### A quick linguistics description

Mandarin Chinese is a pictographic language which means everything: nouns, verbs, concepts and grammar are represented with characters. From these characters, it is not possible to 100% accurately deduce how to pronounce it just from how it looks. Which means all character's pronunciations and appearance must be memorized. But how do we know how to pronounce a character? We can use a romanization system to represent characters in terms of letters or symbols we CAN read. The most popular and the romanization system we will learn in this course is Pinyin since you can read and understand latin letters.

### Let's Dive In

We'll use probably the most common Chinese word as an example. To the left is the character and to the right is its Pinyin (aka how we can represent it in latin letters).

你好 nǐ hǎo (this means "Hello")

Here are the three things that make up the Pinyin (romanization) of a character:
1. Initial
2. Final
3. Tone
  
Each romanization of a character has a starting portion which is the "initial" sound of the word. Although sometimes some characters don't have consonants, but majority do. In this case, "n" and "h" are the initial sounds in nǐ hǎo. Initials are consonants which means they are NOT vowels. In the Pinyin system every letter or string of letters that does not contain an "aieou" is a initial.

And each romanization of a character also has a final ending portion called the "final".
The ǐ  and ǎo, here are finals.  

Next, which could possibly be the most important thing to know is the tone. Every single Chinese word has a tone associated to it and tones are the way we can differentiate between characters that have might have the same initials and finals. It is INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT that you do not skip out on learning and mastering the tones because if you do not, you will not be able to speak and listen at the level you desire. 

If you have a pen and paper next to you, write and sign a pledge that states, "I will not neglect tones because doing so will build a bad habit and be detrimental to my future learning of Mandarin." That is how important it is.

Once you've got that in your head, move on to the next lesson!
