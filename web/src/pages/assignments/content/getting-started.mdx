# Introduction

## Getting Started

The Guan Yu Project is a complete curriculum that teaches users all the tools needed to get from zero Mandarin to whatever level you are trying to achieve. Using the methods and tools prescribed in this curriculum took me from HSK 1 to HSK 5 in just one year. 

If you don't know what this means, this Wikipedia article [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi) (HSK or 汉语水平考试) translates to Chinese Proficiency Level Exam) outlines what each level means. I recommend looking at the 2010-2021 section that only describes HSK 1 to HSK 6. As of Oct 2025, the official exam is now currently up to 9 levels, but majority of learners are familiar with the HSK 1 to 6 system, so for convenience I will continue to refer to only those 6 levels. 

Many learners have trouble finding a goal or purpose that will take their progress beyond the beginning levels of learning Mandarin. Committing to taking a certain level of HSK or even setting the goal of understanding TV shows or movies effortlessly will make the learning process better. I strongly suggest reflecting on why you want to learn Mandarin as this curriculum or any curriculum will not prove to be effective if a clear purpose and goal is made.

This course will split into multiple sections each with its own assignments. I will explain all the concepts needed to understand at a foundational level and I will link videos that I think explain these ideas even further. Please do all the assignments and courses in order and do not be afraid to practice further on your own without rushing and moving on prematurely. The Guan Yu Project is meant to give you the information, but majority of the work and practice will be on your own. If you are diligent, you will find that the methods described here will boost your level at a steady rate. I recommend having a way to take notes beside you while you peruse the lessons.

To dip your feet into this world of learning Mandarin, let's get you a Chinese name. This practice is common as the first thing you do in a beginning Mandarin class. Traditionally, you will be referred to this name by your classmates and teachers, but it's still nice to have one even if there is no direct instruction in this course. There are three ways to obtain a Chinese name.

1. Choose an existing name, perhaps your favorite actor
2. A Chinese name which sounds phonetically like your name in English
3. A Chinese sounding name where the characters represents your personality or values

For methods 2 and 3, you can ask a native Mandarin speaker to provide you with one or ask ChatGPT. And yes, ChatGPT or AI in general is actually incredibly useful for translation, grammar questions and overall language learning. I highly recommend you utilize it for questions you can't find the answer to in these courses.
